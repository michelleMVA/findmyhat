Notes:
I have replaced the following characters:
hat = castle
hole = tree
pathCharacter = knight


Reflection:

What did you like about this project?
It was really fun to do and brought out my once dead creative side. It was also fun trying to figure out how to code some parts of the project.

What did you struggle with in this project?
Definitely how to make the traces of the character disappear once it moves. I only figured it out after I ate dinner. Food helps.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I can't think of anything else. I kind of want to learn how to make a snow man chase after the character.
